# Image-to-Text-OCR
This project demonstrates a robust Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system that converts images containing text into editable, machine-readable text. Built using powerful OCR libraries, it efficiently extracts text from images, making it ideal for applications like document digitization, text analysis, and more.
